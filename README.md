# Linear-Algebra-for-ML-and-PCA
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of systems of linear equations and the geometry of vector space. In the field of machine learning, linear algebra is used to analyze and manipulate large data sets and to create predictive models. Through techniques such as linear regression, singular value decomposition (SVD), and matrix factorization, data scientists can identify patterns in data and create models that can predict future outcomes. In addition, linear algebra is also used for dimensionality reduction, allowing large data sets to be analyzed in a lower-dimensional space, making it easier to understand and analyze. In short, linear algebra is a fundamental tool for the development of machine learning models and algorithms and for the interpretation of large data sets.
